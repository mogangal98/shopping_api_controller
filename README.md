This code monitors a shop's API service to check if customers have paid for our Telegram application's services. 
When a payment is detected, the system automatically grants the customer a membership and sends a notification to admins via Telegram. 
This ensures an automated workflow for managing new memberships. 
Note: Sensitive information, such as shop details, API keys, and database credentials, has been removed from this version.
